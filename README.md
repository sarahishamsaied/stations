# Stations
> A basic React app that sorts rides according to the minimum distance between the user's chosen station code and the stopping stations of every ride.

# User's Data & Ride Data
User's data and rides data are fetched from an external api. 
# Nearest ride:
A nearest ride is a ride that includes your station code or a number closest to your station code in the station_path array.

For example, your station code is 82. 

So any ride that has your station code as nearest number in station_path array.


Hence that would be  id 538 and 107 as they're the most nearest as your station code which is ***82*** in the station_path array (82 - 82 = 0).
